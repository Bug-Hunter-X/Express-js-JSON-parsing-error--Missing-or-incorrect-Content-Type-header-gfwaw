This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where JSON request bodies are not parsed correctly due to missing or incorrect Content-Type headers.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Problem

When sending a POST request to an Express.js server that expects JSON data, the server must correctly identify the request body as JSON.  This is done by setting the `Content-Type` header in the request to `application/json`.  If this header is missing or incorrect, Express.js's `express.json()` middleware may fail to parse the request body, resulting in `req.body` being empty or undefined.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the client sets the `Content-Type` header correctly and handling potential errors gracefully on the server side.  The corrected code includes error handling to catch scenarios where the JSON parsing fails.
